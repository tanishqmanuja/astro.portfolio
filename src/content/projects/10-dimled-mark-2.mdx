A simple led dimmer based on ESP-01 Module powered by esphome firmware.

I designed the complete PCB from scratch using KiCAD 9 and made the enclosure using FreeCAD.

And here's the final assembled PCB,

It’s already running ESPHome with my custom made DDP (Distributed Display Protocol) component, and syncing with music via LedFx. 🎶💡
