During my Internship at UniConverge Technologies, I worked on a project called UCT Dashboard. It is a fullstack web based application that allows to easily create a dynamic dashboard to present data in a visually appealing and interactive way.

UniConverge Technologies is an IOT solution provider that is why a dashboard was required to represent the enormous unfiltered data collected through various devices and sensors in a user friendly and client accessible manner.

## Key Features

- Multi-Dashboard Support
- Dynamic Dashboard Widgets
  - Live Data with time based automatic & manual refresh
  - Draggable and Resizable
  - Zoom and Pan for Graphs
- Multiple Widget Types
  - Line Chart, Bar Chart, Scatter Plot, Text Tile, Meter, Gauge, Button etc.
- User Authentication & Management
- Import/Export of Dashboard

## The Outcome

The goal was to achieve an MVP(Minimum Viable Product) that is a functional dashboard, with rich feature set. UI/UX was not a priority because it can be refined after successful internal test runs.

Here's how easy it is to add a `tile` widget to dashboard showing live data from a public API endpoint `https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json`

Below is a short demo showcasing the widget system of the dashboard, with full support for drag-drop, resize and automatic as well as manual data refresh.

  controls

Flow for the import-export functionality is also simple and user friendly allowing pre-made dashboards from the company to be shared to the clients.

This project was a great learning experience and I am very happy with the result.
