An android app made using Angular, Ionic and CapacitorJS to quickly generate an invoice or estimate PDF file. Additionally, the products and services list is parsed from an excel file and directly embedded into the app.

<Video
  class="mobile"
  src="https://github.com/tanishqmanuja/static/raw/refs/heads/main/assets/abc-ebill/demo.webm"
  aspect-ratio={{ h: 2176, w: 978 }}
  type="webm"
  controls
  loop
></Video>

The above video demonstrates how easy it is to create a pdf and share it.

Despite being a web based app, the experience feels totally native with Material Design 3 based UI and custom card gesture crafted carefully using Ionic's gesture controller.
